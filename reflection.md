Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
  I discussed this assignment with Gemma Qu, Yunxian Ding, and Sophie Zhang.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
  I attended the Monday OH and the Q&A session of Snow Day.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
  It is one of the foundamental programming languages. The use of Java has greatly helped to shape our modern life. I learned Java in AP computer science a in high school, but I almost forgot how to code...
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
  Though I didn't learn Python a lot, I would say the coding logic of these two languages is the same, so I was also be able to write code in Python. A big difference is the syntax rule. Additionally, Python is more straightforward and easier to read. The way you design a project in Jave and Python is also different.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  The mirrored process of words worked well. A little thing is that I tried to write mirrorWords.put("'m "," 're"); to include contractions, but it does not work. I'm also a bit stuck on the Kudos, like the punctuation change.
